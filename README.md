[00:07.02] Moon's up high, shining wide
[00:08.88] Counting sheep on my bed
[00:11.51] Who's still awake? Tossing and turning?
[00:14.47] Little lamb, wool so white
[00:16.40] Why're you hiding from the rest?
[00:18.89] Glow in the dark, come when the sun sets
[00:22.43] Aya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
[00:26.31] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:29.32] Meadow grass swaying slow
[00:31.10] Gentle green with hints of gold
[00:33.74] The twilight paints the end of summer
[00:36.54] Electric sheep, do you dream
[00:38.54] Of machines in your sleep?
[00:41.01] Or do you dream of running far and free
[00:44.75] Aya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
[00:48.42] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:52.22] Aya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
[00:55.93] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[00:58.79] Oh, dami-dami-damio
[01:01.09] Sunlight'll tell me where to go
[01:03.22] We laugh and run, all night long
[01:06.60] Dami-dami-damio
[01:08.59] River guides the way we roam
[01:10.56] When the night is gone, journеy will carry on
[01:14.19] To the secret untold, to thе wonder we hold
[01:17.84] Running out the woods we know, little sheep we tip tap toe
[01:21.64] I wandered high and low, now I don't walk alone
[01:25.33] Together on we go
[01:33.83] 
[01:31.67] Let's find a way out
[01:35.76] Moon's up high, shining wide
[01:37.48] Set my heart upon a quest
[01:40.13] I'm by myself, but far from lonely
[01:43.10] Little lamb, wool so white
[01:44.97] Why're you running on your own?
[01:47.43] I'm just like you, searching for where I belong
[01:51.37] Aya-ya-ya-ya-ya, ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya
[01:58.35] Round and around, around we go
[02:00.24] To the end I'll keep you close
[02:02.34] I'll follow you and be your shadow
[02:05.74] Round and around, around we go
[02:07.50] Count the stars, then off you go
[02:09.67] If I catch you, promise don't hide again, again
[02:15.26] I ring my bell, I ring my bell
[02:21.45] Dami-dami-damio
[02:23.22] Sing the song we used to know
[02:25.31] We ride the winds, into the wild
[02:28.85] Dami-dami-damio
[02:30.56] Sing so loud the sky will know
[02:32.64] We laugh we run, until the break of dawn
[02:36.43] To the secret untold, to the wonder we hold
[02:39.99] Running out the woods we know, little sheep we tip tap toe
[02:43.53] I wandered high and low, now I don't walk alone
[02:47.46] Together on we go
[02:51.22] The stars will take me home
